# Horiseon Webpage

## Description

I upgraded this code to be more organized, easier to read and was able to consolidate the css slectors and added many comments to better explain code. I learned that I should always try to not use divs and to use something more descriptive and organized. I learned how to better consolidate css slectors to cut down how much code you have to look through and be more efficient with my code. 

I also learned how to be more often with my git commands to save my progress as I go and to have a good history of changes made to the code. I also became much more familiar with git and the neccessary commands to properly setup the directories and publish themn to github pages.

## Credits

I give most of the credit fo this project to all the things I learned by doing the work on the Run Buddy in Module-1. I did use many terms and code from that project.
